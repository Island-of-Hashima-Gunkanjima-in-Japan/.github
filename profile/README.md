# Hashima Island: A Ghostly Remnant of Japan's Industrial Past

Emerging from the sea waters off Nagasaki, this place looks quite eerily as if it just walked out of a post-apocalyptic movie. Famous as Hashima Island or Gunkanjima or "Battleship Island," this spooky abandoned island had always been a pot of interest for explorers, historians, and photographers alike. It sits ominously against an eerie backdrop of decayed buildings and places of industrial exploitation, making it one of the most mysterious and reportedly haunted areas in the world.

Through this article, where we aim to take on a little journey into history, we shall tangle with the significance and modern human appeal of Hashima Island, glancing into why that once-thriving mining paradise gradually unravelled to obsolescence and what little remains today. Should one's proclivity ill-favor one into spiraling about unworldly and offbeat happenings, puzutask com offers wise guides and tours from such localities shedding light onto these mysteries of abandonments in a safe and eco-friendly manner.

## What is Hashima Island?

An artificial small island, Hashima Island lies approximately 15 kilometers from Nagasaki. Since the island was in some ways made to resemble a battleship, local residents and tourists alike labeled it as "Battleship Island." With its 6.3-hectare (15.5-acre) area, Hashima in its heyday between the middle 1900s was probably one of the most densely populated places on Earth.

From being a thriving community of miners, laborers, and their families, the island has turned into a ghost that consists of decayed buildings and infrastructure. In the historical context of coal mining and industrialization in Japan, Hashima Island nationally represents Japan's rapid economic development and the harsh realities of industrialization.

## History of Hashima Island

Hashima Island, an island having a very long history of passing hands, was purchased in the late 1800s by Mitsubishi Corp. In 1887, Mitsubishi started the commercial coal mining activities, withdrawing precious coals from the undersea mines located beneath the island. At first, Hashima Island was just a small and sparsely inhabited mining camp. But as coal demand surged early in the 20th century, the island witnessed a population boom.

By the 1950s and 1960s, Hashima Island blossomed up into a rich industrial city with more than 5,000 inhabitants. There were high-rise residential blocks on the island, along with schools, shops, restaurants, and all the amenities that a working-class community could think to have. Hashima was thus, in its way, one of the most modern industrial towns in Japan, with its concrete buildings, full-fledged coal mine, and infrastructure starkly contrasted with the sea.

Life was tough on Hashima Island amidst the flourishing community. The conditions in the plant and living were a bit difficult, and on the cramped little island, people truly lived in close quarters. Instead, the island came to symbolize Japan's rapid industrialization and its ability to forge prosperous communities in the least hospitable areas.

## The Fall of Hashima Island

By way of the 1970s, life was becoming less coal. The coming of oil and natural gas put an end to the flourishing coal industry; thus, with the decrease in the demand of coal, it was simply not worth mining in Hashima. Strange things began to happen to Hashima after 1974, when its coal mine was officially closed and the decline set rapidly.

The closing of the mines made sure that all other businesses supporting the community would also close. Since it lost its main industrial base, there was a mass exodus of the populace of Hashima Island. By 1975, the island was all deserted. Without any men to maintain the houses and buildings and desenvolver infrastructure, they were dilapidated as they once were home to families.

Declared a ghost town overnight, Hashima was soon forgotten as a point in the industrial history of Japan.

For decades, Hashima was never open for the public, leaving lands and buildings to the cataclysmic forces of time and nature. Its ruined buildings, rusting ships, and the barren island offered a ghostly, almost haunting reminder of its past glory.

## What Remains on Gunkanjima Today?

Washed by the elements and battered by time, the island of Hashima is an empty and forlorn land with only a few buildings standing. Dominating the skyline was an apartment block cluster that had the needs and comforts of miners and their families. The buildings now stand in various stages of decay; some have even reached a stage where they have collapsed completely into the sea.

Other than the apartment buildings, the island still bore traces of its industrial pal; coal mine shafts, a concrete water tank, and remains of the power plant. There were minor temples scattered about; all shrines and other edifices: many of the smaller ones have suffered seriously or were destroyed outright through weathering.

The ruins of Hashima Island, with empty rooms and rusting machinery, tell a story of an island that once flourished and is now slowly being reclaimed by nature. The extent of industrialization on Hashima Island stands as evidence for Japan's rapid industrialization and the price it had to pay.

## Going to Hashima Island

Although much of Hashima Island is forbidden ground at present, in fact, it has been turned into a major tourist attraction. Several companies now hold tours to Hashima Island, giving tourists the opportunity to explore abandoned buildings and absorb the island's history.

Thus, only certified and experienced guides should be on the island. A set of strict safety regulations may pertain forbidding access to some locations.

## Gunkanjima Mystery

Since the days when time itself was yet to be counted, each whispered chilling rumor by the Ultras about Hashima Island served to increase the island's allure. Sightings of ghosts, sounds of strange voices emanating from within the deserted buildings-an innumerable number of such stories have put the island on legends: just the perfect place to be left for time to throw away and stand astride while time flows by. The decayed structures speak stories unto themselves, away from what they lived, and now deep into a brutal silence.

The intimidating aura of Hashima Island made it a highly sought location for the filming of numerous television shows and movies. The island was finally immortalized by being shown in the 2012 James Bond movie "Skyfall", somewhere acknowledging the buildup of the narrative; hence, publicity of such movies only doubled the glamour drifted about the island, firmly etching its legacy into the world of abandoned places.

## The Legacy of Hashima Island

Hashima Island may have been deserted, but its steep historical impact on Japan remains. It goes utterly against the memory of an industrial age that demanded such heavy human cost for rapid development. Workers suffered all the inhuman working conditions, all while doing the world-building labor associated almost with industrial growth of Japan.

Today, Hashima Island is a UNESCO World Heritage Site for the heritage and historical contribution toward industrialization in Japan. The eerie beauty of this island and its place in the late industrial architecture of Japan all demand an actual visit by anyone who is either a history, architecture, or even urban exploration aficionado.

Once a vibrant coal-mining community, the island now stands to remind about the high cost industrial progress has exacted and of the temporary nature of human settlements. It is a nearly desert island and yet it attracts tourists from all over the world due to its mystery and history and the ghostly aura around it.
